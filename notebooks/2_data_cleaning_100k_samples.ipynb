He is the author of the highly successful introductory hands-on book, Make: Electronics, and the sequel, Make: More Electronics. His book Easy Electronics claims to be the easiest available introduction to the field. His Make: Tools provides a hands-on introduction to workshop tools. Platt's ambitious reference work, Encyclopedia of Electronic Components, consists of three volumes, two of which were coauthored with physicist Fredrik Jannson. Platt was a Senior Writer for Wired magazine. As a prototype designer, he created semi-automated rapid cooling devices with medical applications, and air-deployable equipment for first responders.

She is Professor of Curriculum and Instruction at Portland State University in Oregon. She is best known for her work in invented spelling, phonics and miscue analysis. She specializes in showing teachers how kids' invented spellings and miscues can help us work with them in more sophisticated and learner-centered ways. Looking at what kids do as they read and write is at the heart of Sandra's presentations and workshops. She can do lively keynote presentations that highlight the interesting things that we can learn by paying close attention to students' invented spellings and miscues, as well as workshops of varying lengths that focus on student-centered teaching of spelling and phonics. She has recently begun offering workshops that focus on understanding students' miscues as a guide to appropriate instruction, p]   \n\n  price  \\\n0  8.23   \n1  3.52   \n\n                                                                                                                                                           images  \\\n0              {'hi_res': [None], 'large': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41X61VPJYKL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg'], 'thumb': [None], 'variant': ['MAIN']}   \n1  {'hi_res': [None], 'large': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41bfTRxpMML._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg'], 'thumb': [None], 'variant': ['MAIN']}   \n\n                                    videos  \\\n0  {'title': [], 'url': [], 'user_id': []}   \n1  {'title': [], 'url': [], 'user_id': []}   \n\n                                           categories  ...  \\\n0  Books > Literature & Fiction > History & Criticism  ...   \n1       Books > Reference > Words, Language & Grammar  ...   \n\n                                          publisher language     isbn_10  \\\n0  Chatto & Windus; First Edition (January 1, 2004)  English  0701169850   \n1           Heinemann; First Edition (May 20, 1996)  English  0435088688   \n\n          isbn_13 page_count  \\\n0  978-0701169855        196   \n1  978-0435088682        316   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 author_dict  \\\n0  {'avatar': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21Je2zja9pL._SY600_.jpg', 'name': 'Peter Ackroyd', 'about': ['Peter Ackroyd, (born 5 October 1949) is an English biographer, novelist and critic with a particular interest in the history and culture of London.

Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.   \n2  Marcus Luttrell, author of the #1 bestseller Lone Survivor , share war stories about true American heroism from himself and other soldiers who bravely fought alongside him. Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell returned from his star-crossed mission in Afghanistan with his bones shattered and his heart broken. So many had given their lives to save him -- and he would have readily done the same for them. As he recuperated, he wondered why he and others, from America's founding to today, had been willing to sacrifice everything-including themselves-for the sake of family, nation, and freedom.  In Service , we follow Marcus Luttrell to Iraq, where he returns to the battlefield as a member of SEAL Team 5 to help take on the most dangerous city in the world: Ramadi, the capital of war-torn Al Anbar Province. There, in six months of high-intensity urban combat, he would be part of what has been called the greatest victory in the history of U.S. Special Operations forces. We also return to Afghanistan and Operation Redwing, where Luttrell offers powerful new details about his miraculous rescue. Throughout, he reflects on what it really means to take on a higher calling, about the men he's seen lose their lives for their country, and the legacy of those who came and bled before.  A thrilling war story, Service is also a profoundly moving tribute to the warrior brotherhood, to the belief that nobody goes it alone, and no one will be left behind.   \n\n   is_free  is_missing

Hornfischer, has written another emotional story that the reader will not want to put down.\"― American Thinker About the Author Marcus Luttrell became a combat-trained Navy SEAL in 2002 and served in many dangerous Special Operations assignments around the world. He is the author of the New York Times bestseller Lone Survivor , and is a popular corporate and organizational speaker. He lives near Houston, Texas. James D. Hornfischer is the author of four bestselling books on the U.S. Navy in World War II, The Fleet at Flood Tide , Neptune's Inferno, Ship of Ghosts, and The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors, winner of the Samuel Eliot Morison Award. He lives in Austin, Texas. Marcus Luttrell, author of the #1 bestseller Lone Survivor , share war stories about true American heroism from himself and other soldiers who bravely fought alongside him. Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell returned from his star-crossed mission in Afghanistan with his bones shattered and his heart broken. So many had given their lives to save him -- and he would have readily done the same for them. As he recuperated, he wondered why he and others, from America's founding to today, had been willing to sacrifice everything-including themselves-for the sake of family, nation, and freedom.  In Service , we follow Marcus Luttrell to Iraq, where he returns to the battlefield as a member of SEAL Team 5 to help take on the most dangerous city in the world: Ramadi, the capital of war-torn Al Anbar Province. There, in six months of high-intensity urban combat, he would be part of what has been called the greatest victory in the history of U.S. Special Operations forces. We also return to Afghanistan and Operation Redwing, where Luttrell offers powerful new details about his miraculous rescue. Throughout, he reflects on what it really means to take on a higher calling, about the men he's seen lose their lives for their country, and the legacy of those who came and bled before.  A thrilling war story, Service is also a profoundly moving tribute to the warrior brotherhood, to the belief that nobody goes it alone, and no one will be left behind. Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell was born in Huntsville, Texas in 1975. {\"Publisher\": \"Little, Brown and Company; 1st edition (May 8, 2012)\", \"Language\": \"English\", \"Hardcover\": \"384 pages\", \"ISBN 10\": \"9780316185363\", \"ISBN 13\": \"978-0316185363\", \"Item Weight\": \"1.4 pounds\", \"Dimensions\": \"6.25 x 1.55 x 9.55 inches\"} Books > Biographies & Memoirs > Leaders & Notable People Little, Brown and Company; 1st edition (May 8, 2012) English  \n\n[3 rows x 24 columns]\nIndex(['main_category', 'rating_number', 'unique_id', 'title', 'subtitle',\n       'cleaned_description', 'cleaned_features', 'is_free', 'is_missing',\n       'is_outlier', 'details_text', 'author_name', 'author_about',\n       'author_avatar', 'categories', 'publisher', 'language',\n       'average_rating', 'isbn_10', 'price_temp_clean', 'page_count',\n       'isbn_13', 'main_images', 'document_text'],\n      dtype='object')\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":26},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import re\n\ndef clean_text(text):\n    if not isinstance(text, str):\n        return \"\"\n    text = text.lower()\n    text = re.sub(r\"\\s+\", \" \", text)          \n    text = re.sub(r\"[{}\\\"]\", \"\", text)       \n    return text.strip()\n\ndf_rag[\"document_text\"] = df_rag[\"document_text\"].apply(clean_text)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-26T12:25:59.726157Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-26T12:25:59.727136Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-26T12:26:24.340256Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-26T12:25:59.727102Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-26T12:26:24.339641Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df_rag.head(3))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-26T12:38:56.564919Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-26T12:38:56.565522Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-26T12:38:56.576007Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-26T12:38:56.565494Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-26T12:38:56.575049Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"  main_category  rating_number       unique_id                        title  \\\n0         Books             29  978-0701169855                      Chaucer   \n1         Books              1  978-0435088682      Notes from a Kidwatcher   \n2         Books           3421  978-0316185363  Service: A Navy SEAL at War   \n\n                              subtitle  \\\n0  Hardcover – Import, January 1, 2004   \n1                        First Edition   \n2              Hardcover – May 8, 2012   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  cleaned_description  \\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n1  About the Author SANDRA WILDE, Ph.D., is widely recognized for her expertise in developmental spelling and her advocacy of holistic approaches to spelling and phonics.

Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.   \n2  Marcus Luttrell, author of the #1 bestseller Lone Survivor , share war stories about true American heroism from himself and other soldiers who bravely fought alongside him. Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell returned from his star-crossed mission in Afghanistan with his bones shattered and his heart broken. So many had given their lives to save him -- and he would have readily done the same for them. As he recuperated, he wondered why he and others, from America's founding to today, had been willing to sacrifice everything-including themselves-for the sake of family, nation, and freedom.  In Service , we follow Marcus Luttrell to Iraq, where he returns to the battlefield as a member of SEAL Team 5 to help take on the most dangerous city in the world: Ramadi, the capital of war-torn Al Anbar Province. There, in six months of high-intensity urban combat, he would be part of what has been called the greatest victory in the history of U.S. Special Operations forces. We also return to Afghanistan and Operation Redwing, where Luttrell offers powerful new details about his miraculous rescue. Throughout, he reflects on what it really means to take on a higher calling, about the men he's seen lose their lives for their country, and the legacy of those who came and bled before.  A thrilling war story, Service is also a profoundly moving tribute to the warrior brotherhood, to the belief that nobody goes it alone, and no one will be left behind.   \n\n   is_free  is_missing

servicean action-packed...reflective saga of contemporary military service.― kirkus reviews marcus luttrell, with james d. hornfischer, has written another emotional story that the reader will not want to put down.― american thinker about the author marcus luttrell became a combat-trained navy seal in 2002 and served in many dangerous special operations assignments around the world. he is the author of the new york times bestseller lone survivor , and is a popular corporate and organizational speaker. he lives near houston, texas. james d. hornfischer is the author of four bestselling books on the u.s. navy in world war ii, the fleet at flood tide , neptune's inferno, ship of ghosts, and the last stand of the tin can sailors, winner of the samuel eliot morison award. he lives in austin, texas. marcus luttrell, author of the #1 bestseller lone survivor , share war stories about true american heroism from himself and other soldiers who bravely fought alongside him. navy seal marcus luttrell returned from his star-crossed mission in afghanistan with his bones shattered and his heart broken. so many had given their lives to save him -- and he would have readily done the same for them. as he recuperated, he wondered why he and others, from america's founding to today, had been willing to sacrifice everything-including themselves-for the sake of family, nation, and freedom. in service , we follow marcus luttrell to iraq, where he returns to the battlefield as a member of seal team 5 to help take on the most dangerous city in the world: ramadi, the capital of war-torn al anbar province. there, in six months of high-intensity urban combat, he would be part of what has been called the greatest victory in the history of u.s. special operations forces. we also return to afghanistan and operation redwing, where luttrell offers powerful new details about his miraculous rescue. throughout, he reflects on what it really means to take on a higher calling, about the men he's seen lose their lives for their country, and the legacy of those who came and bled before. a thrilling war story, service is also a profoundly moving tribute to the warrior brotherhood, to the belief that nobody goes it alone, and no one will be left behind. petty officer first class marcus luttrell was born in huntsville, texas in 1975. publisher: little, brown and company; 1st
