      " 5. [text] twilight hardcover – october 5, 2005 amazon.com review softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. 'be very still,' he whispered, as if i wasn't already frozen. slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. as shakespeare knew, love burns high when thwarted by obstacles. in twilight , an exquisite fantasy by stephenie meyer, readers discover a pair of lovers who are supremely star-crossed. bella adores beautiful edward, and he returns her love. but edward is having a hard time controlling the blood lust she arouses in him, because--he's a vampire. at any moment, the intensity of their passion could drive him to kill her, and he agonizes over the danger. but, bella would rather be dead than part from edward, so she risks her life to stay near him, and the novel burns with the erotic tension of their dangerous and necessarily chaste relationship. meyer has achieved quite a feat by making this scenario completely human and believable. she begins with a familiar ya premise (the new kid in school), and lulls us into thinking this will be just another realistic young adult novel. bella has come to the small town of forks on the gloomy olympic peninsula to be with her father. at school, she wonders about a group of five remarkably beautiful teens, who sit together in the cafeteria but never eat. as she grows to know, and then love, edward, she learns their secret. they are all rescued vampires, part of a family headed by saintly carlisle, who has inspired them to renounce human prey. for edward's sake they welcome bella, but when a roving group of tracker vampires fixates on her, the family is drawn into a desperate pursuit to protect the fragile human in their midst. the precision and delicacy of meyer's writing lifts this wonderful novel beyond the limitations of the horror genre to a place among the best of ya fiction. (ages 12 and up) --patty campbell 10 second interview: a few words with stephenie meyer q: were you a fan of buffy the vampire slayer ? angel ? what are you watching now that those shows are off the air? a: i have never seen an entire episode of buffy or angel . while i was writing twilight , i let my older sister read along chapter by chapter. she's a huge buffy fan and she kept trying to get me to watch, but i was afraid it would mess up my vision of the vampire world so i never did. i don't have a ton of time for tv, and my kids get rowdy when i have on mommy shows, but i do have a secret fondness for reality shows (the good ones, at least in my opinion). i always tivo survivor , the amazing race , and america's next top model . q: what inspired you to write twilight ? is this the beginning of a series? why write for teens? a: twilight was inspired by a very vivid dream, which is fairly faithfully transcribed as chapter thirteen of the book. there are sequels on the way--i'm hard at work editing book two (tentatively titled new moon ) right now, and book three is waiting in line for its turn. i didn't mean to write for teens--i didn't mean to write for anyone but myself, so i had an audience of one twenty-nine year old (and later one thirty-one year old when my sister started reading). i think the reason that i ended up with a book for teens is because high school is such a compelling time period--it gives you some of your worst scars and some of your most exhilarating memories. it's a fascinating place: old enough to feel truly adult, old enough to make decisions that affect the rest of your life, old enough to fall in love, yet, at the same time too young (in most cases) to be free to make a lot of those decisions without someone else's approval. there's a lot of scope for a novel in that. q: what is your favorite vampire story? fave vampire movie? a: i guess my favorite vampire story would be the vampire lestat , by anne rice , simply because it's one of the only ones i've ever read. i keep meaning to pick up bram stoker's dracula , because i get asked this question so often and i should probably start with the classics, but i haven't gotten around to it yet. again, i'm afraid to read other vampire books now, for fear of finding things either too similar, or too different from my own vampire world. ack! i can't even answer the movie question. i can't remember ever seeing a single vampire movie, outside of clips from bela lugosi movies on tv. i don't like true horror movies--my favorite scary movies are all hitchcock's . q: what other young adult authors do you read? a: my favorite young adult author is l.m. montgomery i also enjoy j.k. rowling (but who doesn't?), and ann brashares . as a teen, i skipped straight to adult books (lots of sci-fi and jane austen ), so i'm rediscovering the world of teen literature now. stephenie meyer's list of books you should read anne of green gables romeo and juliet dragonflight to kill a mockingbird the princess bride see more recommendations from stephenie meyer q&a with stephanie meyer q: what book has had the most significant impact on your life? a: the book with the most significant impact on my life is the book of mormon . the book with the most significant impact on my life as a writer is probably speaker for the dead , by orson scott card , with rebecca by daphne du maurier coming in as a close second. q: you are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one cd, and one dvd--what are they? a: the cd is easy: absolution by muse, hands down. it's harder to give myself just one movie, but the one i watch most frequently is sense and sensibility --the one with the screenplay by emma thompson. one book is impossible. i'd have to have pride and prejudice , but i couldn't live without something by orson scott card and a nice, thick maeve binchy , too. q: what is the worst lie you've ever told? a: my lies are all very, very boring: no, you really look great in hot pink! my children only watch one hour of tv a day. i didn't eat the last swiss cake roll--it must have been one of the kids. that's the best i've got. q: describe the perfect writing environment. a: it's late at night and the house is silent, but i'm still (miraculously) full of energy. i have my headphones in and i'm listened to a mix of muse , coldplay , travis , my chemical romance , and the all-american rejects . beside me is a fabulous, and yet mysteriously low in calorie, cheesecake.... q: if you could write your own epitaph, what would it say? a: i'd like it to say that i really tried at the important things. i was never perfect at any of them, but i honestly tried to be a great mom, a loving wife, a good daughter, and a true friend. under that, i'd want a list of my favorite simpsons quotes. q: who is the one person living or dead that you would like to have dinner with? a: i'd love to have a chance to talk to orson scott card--i have a million questions for him. mostly things like, how do you come up with this stuff?! but, if he wasn't available, i'd settle for matthew bellamy (lead singer of muse). q: if you could have one superpower, what would it be? a: i'd want something offensive, rather than defensive. like shooting fireballs from my hands. that way, you're really open to going either way--hero or villain. i like to have choices. from school library journal starred review. grade 9 up–headstrong, sun-loving, 17-year-old bella declines her mom's invitation to move to florida, and instead reluctantly opts to move to her dad's cabin in the dreary, rainy town of forks, wa. she becomes intrigued with edward cullen, a distant, stylish, and disarmingly handsome senior, who is also a vampire. when he reveals that his specific clan hunts wildlife instead of humans, bella deduces that she is safe from his blood-sucking instincts and therefore free to fall hopelessly in love with him. the feeling is mutual, and the resulting volatile romance smolders as they attempt to hide edward's identity from her family and the rest of the school. meyer adds an eerie new twist to the mismatched, star-crossed lovers theme: predator falls for prey, human falls for vampire. this tension strips away any pretense readers may have about the everyday teen romance novel, and kissing, touching, and talking take on an entirely new meaning when one small mistake could be life-threatening. bella and edward's struggle to make their relationship work becomes a struggle for survival, especially when vampires from an outside clan infiltrate the cullen territory and head straight for her. as a result, the novel's danger-factor skyrockets as the excitement of secret love and hushed affection morphs into a terrifying race to stay alive. realistic, subtle, succinct, and easy to follow, twilight will have readers dying to sink their teeth into it. –hillias j. martin, new york public library copyright © reed business information, a division of reed elsevier inc. all rights reserved. from booklist *starred review* gr. 9-12. in the tradition of anne rice and ya titles such as annette curtis klause's the silver kiss (1999) comes this heady romance that intertwines bella swan's life with that of edward, an alluring and tormented vampire. bella's life changes when she moves to perpetually rain-soaked forks, washington. she is instantly drawn to a fellow student, edward cullen, beautiful beyond belief and angrily aloof. bella senses there is more behind edward's hostility, and in a plot that slowly and frighteningly unfolds, she learns that edward and his family are vampires--though they do not hunt humans. yet edward cannot promise that his powerful attraction to bella won't put in her in danger, or worse. recklessly in love, bella wants only to be with edward, but when a vicious, blood-lusting predator complicates her world, bella's peril is brutally revealed. this is a book of the senses: edward is first attracted by bella's scent; ironically, bella is repelled when she sees blood. their love is palpable, heightened by their touches, and teens will respond viscerally. there are some flaws here--a plot that could have been tightened, an overreliance on adjectives and adverbs to bolster dialogue--but this dark romance seeps into the soul. ilene cooper copyright © american library

them and live there. -- time a literary phenomenon. -- the new york times stephenie meyer's life changed dramatically on june 2, 2003. the stay-at-home mother of three young sons woke-up from a dream featuring seemingly real characters that she could not get out of her head. though i had a million things to do (i.e. making breakfast for hungry children, dressing and changing the diapers of said children, finding the swimsuits that no one ever puts away in the right place), i stayed in bed, thinking about the dream. unwillingly, i eventually got up and did the immediate necessities, and then put everything that i possibly could on the back burner and sat down at the computer to write--something i hadn't done in so long that i wondered why i was bothering. meyer invented the plot during the day through swim lessons and potty training, then writing it out late at night when the house was quiet. three months later she finished her first novel, twilight. twilight was one of 2005's most talked about novels and within weeks of its release the book debuted at #5 on the new york times bestseller list.among its many accolades, twilight was named an ala top ten books for young adults, an

starring kristen stewart (into the wild) and robert pattinson (harry potter and the goblet of fire). the highly-anticipated sequel, new moon, was released in september 2006 and spent 31 weeks at the #1 position on the new york times bestseller list. eclipse, the third book in meyer's twilight saga, was released on august 7, 2007 and sold 150,000 copies its first day on-sale. the book debuted at

      " 1. [text] more english fairy tales (forgotten books) unknown book description: a fairy tale or fairy story is a fictional story that usually features folkloric characters (such as fairies, goblins, elves, trolls, witches, giants, and talking animals) and enchantments, often involving a far-fetched sequence of events. in modern-day parlance, the term is also used to describe to something blessed with unusual happiness, as in fairy tale ending (a happy ending) or fairy tale romance, though not all fairy tales end happily. colloquially, a fairy tale or fairy story can also mean any far-fetched story.in cultures where demons and witches are perceived as real, fairy tales may merge into legendary narratives, where the context is perceived by teller and hearers as having historical actuality. however, unlike legends and epics, they usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and actual places, persons, and events; they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times.the history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace, because only the literary forms can survive. still, the evidence of literary works at least indicates that fairy tales have existed for thousands of years, although not perhaps recognized as a genre; the name fairy tale was first ascribed to them by madame d'aulnoy. literary fairy tales are found over the centuries throughout the world, and when folklorists collected them, they found fairy tales in every culture. fairy tales, and works derived from fairy tales, are still written today.the older fairy tales were intended for an audience of adults as well as children, but they were associated with children as early as the writings of the precieuses; the brothers grimm titled their collection children's and household tales, and the link with children has only grown stronger with time.

      " 3. [text] fabulous creatures, mythical monsters, and animal power symbols: a handbook unknown from school library journal grade 9 up—eason's work is closer to a personal collection of anecdotes and information than a systematic examination of the topic. her sources range from the ancient to the contemporary with both literary and oral and eastern and western origins. chapters cover animal worship, serpents, dragons, birds, magical animals, monsters, clan animals, water-creatures, and prophetic animals. the book's structure is sometimes nonintuitive (e.g., herne is not mentioned in the animal-lord section), and given the few cross-references, a more inclusive index would have been helpful. information is abundant but incomplete. the lilith entry makes no mention of the dual creation accounts of genesis and the perseus and andromeda myth is not cited as a model for st. george. the absence of illustrations (besides two black-and-white hieroglyph drawings) reduces the work's browsing potential; excluding internet citations further weakens the volume's utility.— patricia d. lothrop, st. george's school, newport, ri copyright © reed business information, a division of reed elsevier inc. all rights reserved. review . . . this volume is compelling. . . . ideally suited to casual readers and younger scholars interested in world folklore, mythology, and monsters. ― reference reviews about the author cassandra eason is the author of more than 75 books on all aspects of mythology, magic, the paranormal, maternal intuition, and childhood spirituality. she is a former honorary research fellow at the alister hardy research center for religious and spiritual experience in oxford, england, specializing in children's spiritual and religious experiences. read more eason provides an extensive overview of the mythology, legends, and folklore surrounding fabulous and strange fantasy creatures from diffferent lands and ages, from chinese dragons and the native north american thunderbird to the demon hounds of celtic and norse legend. she describes how in various ages and cultures people have identified with the idealized qualities of wise creatures as a source of power and better understanding of their own personalities and used the behavior of birds and other sacred creatures to gain oracular information in ancient egypt and the classical and celtic worlds. this book offers both traditional and little known folklore and legend about familiar real life creatures such as the horse, the cat, and the raven and delves into the weird and wonderful world of saints who claimed to change into deer and modern cryptozoological monsters such as bigfoot, mothman, and lake and sea monsters, as well as the rationale behind animal or headed deities of the aztecs, egyptians, and celts in whose name people went to war. about the author cassandra eason is one of the most prolific and popular authors of our time, writing on all aspects of spirituality and magick, including her bestselling 1001 spells soon to be joined in the series by 1001 tarot spreads with sterling ethos/barnes and noble. other bestselling titles with sterling include in the little bit of series her a little bit of palmistry, little bit of auras, little bit of crystals, little bit of tarot, little bit of wicca and little bit of runes. her palmistry book has been widely acclaimed for making an often unnecessarily obscure subject totally accessible to beginners and a powerful tool for people reading her new crystal bible, reprinted and re-titled many times over ten years, now called crystals and the complete crystal handbook (us with sterling) continues to feature in high selling lists throughout the world and is respected by crystal sellers, experts and newcomers alike. she also lectures, broadcasts and facilitates workshops throughout the world on all aspects of the paranormal. during the past forty years cassandra has written over 130 titles, many of which have been translated into numerous languages, including japanese, chinese, russian, hebrew, portuguese, german, french, dutch and spanish. cassandra was a teacher and university lecturer for ten years, trained also in psychology. however, her life path was to change following a vision by her 3-year-old son, who accurately described a motorcycle accident in which his father was involved at the time of his prediction. jack said daddy’s fallen off his motorbike, but he is ok, as forty miles away her husband’s motor bike was skidding on a patch of oil. her husband fell off but was unhurt. the motorcycle clock stopped at the time of impact and was verified as precisely the same time jack spoke as cassandra had been clock-watching for her husband to return from an overnight shift. following a great deal of research into this phenomenon, cassandra went on to write the bestseller the psychic power of children, the first in a long list of titles which would establish her as a worldwide best-selling author. she is also now widely acknowledged as a world expert on parent/child intuitive links. she was for a time an honorary research fellow at the alister hardy research centre for spiritual and religious experience. her books have been serialized around the world including the uk daily mail, the daily mirror, the daily express, the people and the sun, in the news of the world magazine, in spirit and destiny, fate and fortune, prediction, best and bella, homes and gardens and good housekeeping in the national enquirer many times in the us and in woman’s day and new idea in australia. she had her own psychic column in the national women’s magazine best and in writers news for two years and for eighteen months produced a monthly psychic master class for beyond magazine. cassandra appeared on the nbc unsolved mysteries and the other side and with paramount sightings. in the uk she had her own weekly mini-series, sixth sense, on united artists cable network for several years, moving on to granada breeze where she was resident white witch for over two years on psychic live time. she also analyzed dreams for several years on the uk channel 4 big brother series 3 and 4 and celebrity big brother. she is a mother of five children and grandmother to four whom she considers her greatest joy and achievement. she lives on the rural isle of wight off the south coast of england. cassandra has been working on a series with sterling of young witch’s guides to magick and crystals to make the spiritual accessible and safe for younger readers. she has an extensive website www.cassandraeason.com offering readings, spells and courses on all psychic and magical topics. she is currently creating a three-year magick course for those who wish to study privately and at their own pace or explore just a few topics. the website also contains information on the full moons of the year and the seasons and links with her twitter and instagram accounts as
